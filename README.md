# Teachable Frontend Engineer, Data Visualization Homework

Using d3.js or another visualization library of your choice, make one or more graphs of the accompanying dataset, `data.csv`. The dataset is a simulated table of course sales, including date (in YYYY-MM-DD format), school_id, course_id, school/course category, student_id, and price in cents (integer). Please create an interactive control allowing the user to select the ‘category’ to display. 

Please produce an HTML document with embedded or accompanying JavaScript, and CSS if required. We must be able to run the page you provide in a browser locally, or be able to access a running version at a Github page or similar. (Please be sure to include working links to import external libraries).

This is an open-ended assignment with no specific ‘correct’ answer; we are interested in seeing how you approach data visualization and how you think the data should be presented. We are interested in both the visualization you produce, and the code you write to produce it.

Please spend no more than __three__ hours on this assignment. If there is additional work you would do with more time, please include that in a README or some other form of documentation.

To submit, create a private Git repo containing your code and send the link to your recruiting contact.
